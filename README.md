# Description
## It is every hospital's dream to have a 5-star rating as it signifies the level of patient-care quality provided. 
The rating is one of many ways to showcase quality recognition and reputation. The dataset by Centers of Medicare and Medicaid, was downloaded on Kaggle dataset. 
This data can help us compare the quality  of care among hospitals in the USA. This is an interesting project as the data can be used for predictive modeling using Python. 
The result of the machine learning algorithms can have implications.
